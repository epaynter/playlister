## Files

- `main.py` - Main application with UI
- `setup_auth.py` - One-time authentication setup script
- `spotify_auth.py` - Spotify OAuth and config management
- `config.json` - Auto-generated file storing credentials and preferences
- `.spotify_cache` - Auto-generated token cache

## Troubleshooting

**"Failed to authenticate"**: Check that your Client ID and Client Secret are correct. Delete `config.json` and `.spotify_cache`, then run `python setup_auth.py` again.

**"No track playing"**: Make sure Spotify is open and actively playing music.

**Can't add to playlist**: Ensure you have permission to modify the playlist (you must be the owner or have edit rights).

## Notes

- The app checks for the currently playing track every 2 seconds
- The window is small (350x180px) and always stays on top
- Your selected playlist preference is saved automatically
